* Move tests into own files/modules
* Test that AI only considers suspicions/hands that are compatible with the cards played so far
* implement more rules
* split CStich into CStichComplete and CStichCurrent
* "graphical" output (possibly via libaa/libcaca) (possibly by augmenting/impriving ask_for_alternative)
* simplify count_runnings: consider only highest trumpf per party
* &Box<X> => &X
* introduce actively_playable_rules (shall be offered by what currently is called "all_allowed_rules")
* fix graphical output (currently, it is often cleared when ai is running)
* add indication to show that ai is working
* clean up mess introduced by SAiCheating-Commit
* compute_successors should acknowledge ostich_given
* could susp_from_raw construct m_ahand on its own (to ensure ahand.iter().transform(hand.size()).all_same)
* should rules/mod.rs reexport all necessary things for concrete rules?
* VTrumpfOrFarbe should not be publicly exported (concept of Trumpf/Farbe should be internal to TRules)
* sort_cards_fist_trumpf_then_farbe should not be needed (concept of Trumpf/Farbe should be internal to TRules)
