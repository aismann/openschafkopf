# rs_schafkopf [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phimuemue/rs_schafkopf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phimuemue/rs_schafkopf) [![Clippy Linting Result](https://clippy.bashy.io/github/phimuemue/rs_schafkopf/master/badge.svg)]

This project is a work in progress, aiming to model the game Schafkopf in a robust and extensible manner. Moreover, it aims to provide an AI playing the game. As of now, it does *not* provide any fancy user interface, but instead relies on the command line.
