* 1 plays SZ (instead of Trumpf) in stich 3, thus preventing me from getting both GK and SU.

* 1 keeps HO to be obtain stich 4, where 3 schmiers correctly.
* Interesting: 1 plays GA in stich 2, plays HK in stich 4

* 1 plays HO in Stich 1. => TODO: Possibly, we should acknowledge that a (Solo-)Player probably has above average cards.
* 3 gets stich 4 wich SO.
* 3 plays EA in stich 7. => Maybe because it made no difference anyway?

* AI suggests to play E9 in stich 7 (possibly because it does not matter for payout, anyway).
